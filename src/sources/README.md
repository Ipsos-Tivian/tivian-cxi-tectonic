Sources
=======

Sources define how we request data from your server.  The available sources are:

- superagent
- http

In the future it would be great to add Falcor and GraphQL endpoints.

### Superagent

Why superagent?  You can build your API as an SDK separately from your frontend
project ([see
here](https://tonyhb.gitbooks.io/redux-without-profanity/content/data_loading_building_an_sdk.html)).
