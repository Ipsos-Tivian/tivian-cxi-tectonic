## Tectonic example

This example project uses react, react router, postcss, json-server etc. to
create a standalone frontend as an example of using tectonic.

## To run:

- `make` to run inside a docker container, or
` `npm start` to run outside of docker

Note that this is actually the frontends for one of my side projects I'm
working on.  I'll keep it updated (pun intended) as it progresses.

## TODO:

- Move to styled-components, allowing us to retheme easily.
- Remove redux-ui if possible (need to rebuild this to be more lightweight)
